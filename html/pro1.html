    <h1>MYSORE VISIT PLACES</h1>
    <h1>Abby falls -Coorg</h1>
    <p>Abbey Falls (also spelled Abbi Falls and Abbe Falls) is a waterfall in <a href="">Kodagu</a>, in the <a href="">Western Ghats</a> of Karnataka, <a href="">India</a>. It is located 8 km from the <a href="">Madikeri</a>, 122 km from <a href="">Mysore</a>, 144 km from <a href="">Mangalore</a> and 268 km from <a href="">Bangalore</a>.[1]

        The waterfall is on the early reaches of the river <a href="">Kaveri</a>, located between private <a href="">coffee plantations</a> with stocky coffee bushes and spice estates and trees entwined with pepper vines. There is a <a href="">hanging bridge</a> constructed just opposite the falls. Flow is much higher during the monsoon season.[2]
        
        The falls was earlier called Jessi Falls, named after a British officer's wife. However, the place was a thick jungle back then. Years later, the waterfall was discovered by Mr. Neravanda B. Nanaiah who bought the place from the government and converted it into a coffee and spice plantation, which still surrounds the waterfall today.

    <h1>Mysore Palace</h1>
    <p>Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence. It is located in <a href="">Mysore, Karnataka</a>, India. It used to be the official residence of the <a href="">Wadiyar dynasty</a> and the seat of the <a href="">Kingdom of Mysore</a>. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of the Palaces', and there are <a href="">seven palaces</a> including this one. However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort.

        The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). The first palace inside the Old Fort was built in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the <a href="">Taj Mahal</a>, with more than three million annual visitors as on 2014.[1]
