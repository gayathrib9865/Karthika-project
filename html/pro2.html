            <p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the <a href="">genus Rosa</a> (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of <a href="">cultivars</a>.[5] They form a group of plants that can be erect <a href="">shrubs, climbing</a>, or <a href="">trailing</a>, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to <a href="">Europe</a>, <a href="">North America</a>, and <a href="">Northwest Africa</a>.[6] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[6] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>

            <p>Jasmine (botanical name: Jasminum; /ˈjæsmɪnəm/ YAS-mih-nəm)[5] is a genus of <a href="">shrubs and vines</a> in the olive family of Oleaceae.[4][6][7]: 193  It contains around 200 species native to tropical and warm temperate regions of <a href="">Eurasia</a>, <a href="">Africa,</a> and <a href="">Oceania</a>.[7]: 194  Jasmines are widely cultivated for the characteristic fragrance of their flowers. Additionally a number of unrelated species of plants or flowers contain the word "jasmine" in their common names (see Other plants called "jasmine").</p>

            <h1 id="hibiscus">Hibiscus</h1>
            <p>Hibiscus[2][3] is a genus of flowering plants in the <a href="">mallow family</a>, <a href="">Malvaceae</a>. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as "hibiscus", or less widely known as rose mallow.

                The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees. The generic name is derived from the Greek name ἰβίσκος (ibískos) which Pedanius Dioscorides gave toa <a href="">Althaea officinalis</a> (c. 40–90 AD).[4][5]
                
                Several species are widely cultivated as <a href="">ornamental plants</a>, <a href="">notably Hibiscus syriacus </a>and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis.[6]
                
                A tea made from the flowers of Hibiscus sabdariffa is known by many names around the world and is served both hot and cold. The beverage is known for its red colour, tart flavour, and vitamin C content.

            <p>Catharanthus roseus, commonly known as <a href="">bright eyes</a>, <a href="">Cape periwinkle</a>, <a href="">graveyard plant</a>, <a href="">Madagascar periwinkle,</a> old maid, pink periwinkle, rose periwinkle,[2] is a perennial species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native and endemic to Madagascar, but is grown elsewhere as an ornamental and medicinal plant, and now has a pantropical distribution. It is a source of the drugs vincristine and vinblastine, used to treat cancer.[3] It was formerly included in the genus Vinca as Vinca rosea.

                It has many vernacular names among which are arivotaombelona or rivotambelona, tonga, tongatse or trongatse, tsimatiririnina, and vonenina</p>

            <h1 id="Lilium">Lilium</h1>
            <p>Lilies are tall <a href="">perennials</a> ranging in height from 1–6 ft (30–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their organs of <a href="">perennation</a>. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop <a href="">stolons</a>.[5] Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number of species also produce contractile roots that move the bulbs deeper into the soil.[6]


                Lily, petal
                The flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide range of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in racemes or umbels at the tip of the stem, with six tepals spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a "Turk's cap". The tepals are free from each other, and bear a nectary at the base of each flower. The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment of the anthers. The fruit is a three-celled capsule.[7]
                
                
                Stamen of lilium
                <a href="">Seeds</a> ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex germination patterns, many adapted to cool temperate climates.
                
                Most cool temperate species are deciduous and dormant in winter in their native environment. But a few species native to areas with hot summers and mild winters (Lilium candidum, Lilium catesbaei, Lilium longiflorum) lose their leaves and enter a short dormant period in summer or autumn, sprout from autumn to winter, forming dwarf stems bearing a basal rosette of leaves until, after they have received sufficient chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming weather.

                The basic <a href="">chromosome number</a> is twelve (n=12).[8]
                
                In 2017, lilies ranked as the second most favorite flower among UK residents, highlighting their enduring popularity and cultural significance [9]</p>
